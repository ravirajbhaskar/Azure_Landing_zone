🏗️ Architecture Overview

This architecture is designed to support cloud-native workloads, including VM-based admin access, AKS container platforms, secure DevOps pipelines, and a scalable database layer.

The system ensures:
✔ Zero-trust secure access
✔ Scalable compute with AKS
✔ Secure secret management
✔ CI/CD-ready microservices architecture
✔ Isolated subnet-level security
✔ Terraform modular & reusable infra

🧩 Infrastructure Components
Compute

💻 Virtual Machine (Jump/Worker VM)

🛡️ Azure Bastion (Secure login)

☸️ Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Networking

🌐 VNet

🔹 VM Subnet

🔹 AKS Subnet

🔹 Bastion Subnet

🌍 Public IP

🔌 NIC

🛡️ NSG

Storage & Database

💾 Storage Account

🗄️ Azure SQL Server + SQL Database

Security

🔐 Key Vault (Secrets, Keys, Certificates)

DevOps Platform

📦 Azure Container Registry (ACR) (Docker Images)

🔄 Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions CI/CD

🧠 Why This Architecture? (Logic + Best Practices Explanation)
🔒 Security First Approach

No VM has a Public IP (SSH/RDP only via Bastion)

Key Vault stores DB passwords, SPN secrets, AKS credentials

NSG restricts traffic

AKS → ACR authenticated via Managed Identity

🧱 Network Segmentation

VM Subnet for admin/jump host

AKS Subnet for Kubernetes Node Pools

Bastion Subnet for Azure Bastion isolation

☸️ Production-Grade AKS Cluster

Integrated with ACR for container images

Supports Load Balancer (internal/external)

Supports Blue/Green or Canary Deployments

📦 Image Lifecycle

DevOps pipelines build + push Docker images → ACR → AKS pulls → Deployment rollout

🗄️ SQL Server for Application Data

Central relational DB

Can be accessed using private endpoints

🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Strategy (Infra + Application)

This project uses a secure, production-grade CI/CD workflow leveraging both GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps, designed to ensure:

✔ Zero vulnerabilities
✔ Fully automated infrastructure deployments
✔ Secure application container lifecycle
✔ Continuous monitoring & observability

This pipeline setup follows DevSecOps best practices.
| Tool           | Purpose                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **TFLint**     | Terraform linting & coding standards        |
| **TruffleHog** | Detects hardcoded secrets in TF code        |
| **tfsec**      | Static code analysis for Terraform security |
| **Checkov**    | Cloud misconfiguration scanning             |


Infrastructure Pipeline Flow (GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps)

📌 Stage 1 — Pre-Commit Validation
    ✔ Terraform fmt
    ✔ Terraform validate
    ✔ TFLint (linting)
    ✔ Trufflehog (secret scanning)

📌 Stage 2 — Security Scan
    ✔ tfsec for IaC vulnerabilities
    ✔ Checkov full infrastructure compliance check
    ✔ Policy-as-code validation (if enabled)

📌 Stage 3 — Terraform Plan
    ✔ Generate execution plan
    ✔ Store plan artifact
    ✔ Requires manual approval for production

📌 Stage 4 — Terraform Apply
    ✔ Deploy modular infrastructure
    ✔ Push state to remote backend (Azure Storage)



    
🐳 2. Application Build & Deployment Pipeline (DevOps)
Application is containerized and deployed into AKS using enterprise-grade CI/CD.
🛡️ Security Tools Integrated for Application
Tool	Purpose
Trivy	Vulnerability scanning of Docker images
SonarQube	Static code analysis (quality + security)

Application CI/CD Workflow

📌 Stage 1 — Code Quality & Security
    ✔ SonarQube scan
    ✔ Unit testing
    ✔ Secrets scanning (GitLeaks optional)

📌 Stage 2 — Build & Scan Container
    ✔ Docker build
    ✔ Trivy image scan (High/Critical vulnerabilities blocked)
    ✔ Push to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

📌 Stage 3 — Deploy to AKS
    ✔ Update deployment manifests / Helm charts
    ✔ Patch image tag
    ✔ kubectl/Helm apply
    ✔ Health probes validation

📌 Stage 4 — Progressive Delivery (Optional)
    ✔ Canary rollouts
    ✔ Blue/Green deployments
    ✔ Auto rollback on failure


    
📊 3. Monitoring & Observability (Production Setup)
This architecture uses Prometheus + Grafana for deep observability.
| Tool                     | Purpose                                            |
